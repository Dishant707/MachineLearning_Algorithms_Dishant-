## üõ†Ô∏è Algorithms and Scripts

Below is a summary of the five scripts included in this repository, along with their respective algorithms, datasets, and expected outputs:

| **Script**                     | **Algorithm**                | **Dataset**             | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `1_logistic_regression.py`     | Logistic Regression          | Iris                    | Classifies iris flowers into three species using sepal and petal measurements.   |
| `2_decision_tree.py`           | Decision Tree Classifier     | Titanic                 | Predicts passenger survival on the Titanic based on age, sex, and class.         |
| `3_knn.py`                     | K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)    | Digits                  | Classifies handwritten digits (0-9) based on pixel intensities.                  |
| `4_svm.py`                     | Support Vector Machine (SVM) | Breast Cancer           | Classifies tumors as malignant or benign using tumor measurements.               |
| `5_random_forest.py`           | Random Forest Classifier     | Wine                    | Classifies wine types based on chemical properties.                              |

### Expected Outputs
- **Logistic Regression**: Accuracy (~0.97) and a classification report with precision, recall, and F1-scores for each iris species.
- **Decision Tree**: Accuracy (~0.78-0.82) and a confusion matrix showing true/false positives/negatives.
- **KNN**: Accuracy (~0.98) and sample predictions for the first five test digits.
- **SVM**: Accuracy (~0.95-0.97) and a classification report for malignant/benign classes.
- **Random Forest**: Accuracy (~0.97-1.00) and feature importance rankings for wine dataset features.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/MachineLearning_Algorithms_YourName
   cd MachineLearning_Algorithms_YourName
   ```

2. **Run a Script**:
   ```bash
   python 1_logistic_regression.py
   ```
   Replace with the desired script name (e.g., `2_decision_tree.py`).

### Running the Scripts
Each script is self-contained and uses scikit-learn's built-in datasets, so no external data files are needed. Run any script to see the model train, predict, and output evaluation metrics to the console.

## üìä Sample Output
Here‚Äôs an example of what to expect when running `1_logistic_regression.py`:
```
Logistic Regression on Iris Dataset
Accuracy: 0.9667
Classification Report:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
    setosa       1.00      1.00      1.00        10
versicolor       0.92      1.00      0.96        12
 virginica       1.00      0.88      0.93         8
accuracy                            0.97        30
macro avg       0.97      0.96      0.96        30
weighted avg    0.97      0.97      0.97        30
```

Similar outputs are generated for other scripts, including accuracy, confusion matrices, or feature importances, as described in each script‚Äôs comments.

## üí° Why This Repository?
- **Educational**: Perfect for learning machine learning algorithms with clear, commented code.
- **Reproducible**: Uses standard scikit-learn datasets, ensuring anyone can run the scripts.
- **Practical**: Demonstrates real-world applications like medical diagnosis (SVM) and survival prediction (Decision Tree).

---

## üìù Notes
- The scripts are designed for Python 3.7+ and require scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.
- Outputs may vary slightly due to random train-test splits, but accuracy is typically above 0.8 for all models.
- For further exploration, try modifying hyperparameters (e.g., `n_neighbors` in KNN or `n_estimators` in Random Forest) to see their impact!
